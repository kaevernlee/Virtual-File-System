# Virtual-File-System
I've tried to implement my own virtual file system in C -- It's still a working progress but the majority of the functions work as expected! It's suppose to replicate how a file system would work on an operating system -- works with mainly binary files.

INTRO: The program takes in 3 files specifcying: directory_table, file_data and hash_data
1) When you input your own directory file: The first 64 bytes are allocated to the name of the file, if it starts with a "NULL" character, the system will assume that the entire file is deleted and the data in the file data allocated with the file name is free to overwrite. The next 8 bytes refer to the offset and length respectively of the file in the file data.
2) You can assume that the directory table file is written 72 bytes at a time with the specifications above.
3) The file data must be directory specified in the directory table -- can be analogised as random space only defined by the directory table.
4) The hash data is automatically computed as you do functions with the files within the program.

Some default test files have been added.
